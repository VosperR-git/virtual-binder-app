\## ðŸš€ How to Run Locally



Because this is a static web application, you can run it in two ways:



\### 1. Simple Method (Directly in Browser)



Simply double-click the `index.html` file to open it in your default web browser.



\### 2. Recommended Method (Using a Local Server)



Running a local server avoids potential browser issues with local file paths. If you have Node.js and npm installed, you can use a simple package like `http-server`.



1\.  \*\*Install `http-server` (if you haven't already):\*\*

&nbsp;   ```bash

&nbsp;   npm install -g http-server

&nbsp;   ```



2\.  \*\*Navigate to the project directory in your terminal:\*\*

&nbsp;   ```bash

&nbsp;   cd path/to/virtual-binder

&nbsp;   ```



3\.  \*\*Start the server:\*\*

&nbsp;   ```bash

&nbsp;   http-server . -o

&nbsp;   ```

&nbsp;   This will start the server and automatically open the app in your browser.



\## ðŸ“¦ How to Deploy



This project consists of only static files (`HTML`, `CSS`, `JS`). You can deploy it for free on numerous platforms:



\-   \*\*Netlify:\*\* Drag and drop the `virtual-binder` folder onto the Netlify dashboard.

\-   \*\*Vercel:\*\* Connect your Git repository and it will deploy automatically.

\-   \*\*GitHub Pages:\*\* Enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings on the `main` branch.

\-   \*\*Cloudflare Pages:\*\* Similar to Netlify and Vercel.
